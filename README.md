# JavaScript Projects

This folder contains several JavaScript projects that I created while studying JavaScript. 

The projects contained serve as an example of my profiency in basic and intermediate JavaScript.

Each individual project contains a project description in its comments, to provide context on what the code is supposed to do.

As of 10/07/2023 this folder contains the following projects:

1. Palindrome Checker
  Enter a string and check if it is a palindrome or not.

2. Roman Numeral Converter
  Enter a number and convert it into Roman numerals.

3. Caesar's Cipher (basic decryption algorithm)
  Enter an encrypted string and decrypt it. 

4. Telephone Number Validator
  Enter a phone number and validate it.

5. Cash Register
  Simulate a transaction with a cash register.

6. Random MessageGenerator
  Generate a random inspiring message, including output in HTML. 

7. Creditcard Validator
  Validate a creditcard number.

8. mysteriousOrganisms
  Simulate the evolution of a single celled organism.

I hope that you will enjoy reading my code as much as I have enjoyed learning how to write it.
